# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

When our pages make requests the browser logs them into the developer tools network tab, which means that making API requests with API keys from the frontend will result in that API key getting logged by the browser which can then be stolen by people with malicious intent. Making API requests from the server hides the API keys more efficiently because the server can have its own endpoints to make the fetch and the browser would log these endpoints instead of logging the fetches.
