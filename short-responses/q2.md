# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

Environment variables are variables stored in the host's device (their own device or Render.com). These variables are stored in a `.env` file that is ignored by Github but is uploaded to Render when our app is deployed. The variables in the `.env` file can be accessed in Node by using the `process.env` object.
